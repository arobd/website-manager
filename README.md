## Installation

**Prerequisites**

Register and get an API Key from Whois XML API: https://main.whoisxmlapi.com/. It is FREE (500 requests per month and that is enough).

Register slack webhooks for uptime notifications. Go here: https://slack.com/apps/A0F7XDUAZ-incoming-webhooks & setup your slack. Get webhooks UR.

If you want to get a call when your monitor is down, twilo is already integrated. You just need to fill twilo auth keys, from & to numbers.
